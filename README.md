# 📚 My First Class Routine Table 🕒

Hey there! 👋 This is my first attempt at creating a class timetable using **HTML** and **CSS**. I’m just starting out with tables, and this project helped me understand the basics while having some fun with it. 😊

---

## 🖼️ What’s This About?

This project is a simple class routine for a week. It includes:
- 📆 Days of the week and time slots for each class.
- 🍴 A dedicated "Lunch" break column styled differently.
- 🎨 A bit of CSS to make the table look neat and clean.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside?

- **index.html**: The main file where I wrote the table structure.  
- **styles.css**: A small stylesheet that adds some style to the table.  

---

## 🌟 What I Learned

- How to create a table in **HTML**.  
- Using `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `colspan`, and `rowspan` to structure data.  
- Adding some basic **CSS** to make the table look good.  
- The importance of breaking things down and starting small when learning something new! 💪

## 🤔 Why Did I Make This?

I made this project because I wanted to learn how tables work in HTML. I kept the design simple so I could focus on understanding the basics. It might look basic, but it was a big step for me. 🌱

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

I’m thinking about:  
- Adding some hover effects to make the table interactive. 🖱️  
- Learning how to make it responsive so it works on mobile screens too. 📱  
- Maybe even using JavaScript later to make it dynamic! 🚀
